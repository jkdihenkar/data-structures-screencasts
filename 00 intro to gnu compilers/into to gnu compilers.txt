Hello friends, let's start with the GNU Compiler Collection - GCC

It's the free open source Compiler collection and used mostly
 for C and C++ programming! It's professionally used for compiling the
 realworld application! The importance of learning the GCC Collection and
 programming in this environment instead of TurboC or with any other compiler
 that this compiler suite is used widely and extensively for almost all of 
 C and C++ projects. Linux Kernel compiles through GCC!!
 
So!! Thats intro... Lets gets started! :)

--> 1. Obtaining the GCC
    Download the tar.gz!
    extract
    <login as root>
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    <and the tool will be installed!!> -- but mostly this compiler suite is available by default under unix and mac environment!
    How to check???
2. Compiling the C files
3. Compiling the C++ files

Note for TurboC users : 
1. The GNU GCC Compiler doesn/t have the "conio.h" library!
      so dont use the functions : "clrscr()" and "getch()"
2. the main() function must have "int" return type!
      void main() -->generates error!
      int main() --> is correct!
      
      Soo thats all for this screen cast! See you in the next :)
      Thanks for watching! :)
